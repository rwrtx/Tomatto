A snapshot of the FAQ (updated 13.4.2019):


I managed to get invalid data into the database after ... playing around with
the system clock / doing some strange network experiments / having the cron
entry not properly configured. Is there a database editor available?

  Nothing vnStat specific is available. The sqlite3 command can be used to
  read and modify the database.


How do I stop monitoring an interface?

  Execute "vnstat --remove -i interfacename" with correct permissions.


How do I uninstall vnStat?

  You only need to run 'make uninstall' in the directory that comes when the
  .tar.gz is extracted. Just make sure it's the same version you have
  installed. If you've used a binary package included with the distribution
  then refer to intructions provided by the package manager.


What is this KiB/MiB/GiB/TiB thing?

  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix#Prefixes and UnitMode
  option in the configuration file.


Is the MB value reported by vnStat 10^6 or 2^20 bytes?

  2^20 bytes. The prefix can be configured to show MiB from the configuration
  file instead of MB if that looks better.


What does the 'estimated' value mean?

  The estimated value is an calculated average that tries to predict the total
  traffic for the current day/month based on previous traffic. This estimate
  works fairly well if the monitored interface has constant traffic of the same
  magnitude (like game servers). It can't predic peaks but the accuracy
  usually gets better by the end of the day/month.


Why isn't the estimated value shown with --json or xml outputs?

  Those features only dump the database and since the estimate is always
  calculated in real time, there's no reason to write it into the database.


How is the estimated value calculated?

  estimate = ( x / y ) * z

    x = traffic so far for the day/month
    y = passed minutes/hours ...
    z = total minutes/hours ...


About bug reports

  If the latest version isn't being used then test if the issue can still
  be replicated with the latest or latest development version. If the issue
  can still be reproduced, check if there's already an issue open in GitHub.
  If not then using https://github.com/vergoh/vnstat/issues for reporting new
  issues is suggested. Any bug report should at least include an explanation
  about how the bug can be reproduced. Also include information about the used
  distribution, kernel (uname -a), compiler (gcc --version) and network
  interface card. Read the report again before sending it. :)
